# XYZ Bullet Formula

The XYZ formula structures resume bullets for maximum impact:

```
Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]
```

- **X** = What you accomplished (the result or impact)
- **Y** = Quantifiable metric (number, percentage, time saved, scale)
- **Z** = How you did it (method, tools, approach)

## Rules

1. **Lead with the accomplishment**, not the task
2. **Quantify whenever possible** — even rough numbers beat no numbers
3. **Include tools/technologies** naturally in the Z component to hit ATS keywords
4. **Use strong action verbs**: Architected, Engineered, Developed, Built, Led, Delivered, Automated, Designed, Optimized, Reduced
5. **One bullet = one accomplishment** — don't stack multiple achievements

## Before / After Examples

### Weak (task-focused)
> Worked on a quantitative research project for equity portfolios.

### Strong (XYZ format)
> Built an end-to-end quantitative research framework for systematic equity portfolios, automating attribution and factor performance reporting to reduce reporting time by over 90% and deliver actionable insights to the Head of Quant Research

---

### Weak
> Helped with the MLX evaluation platform.

### Strong
> Architected the MLX evaluation environment for a sovereign, multi-tenant LLM platform on Apple Silicon; developed a Python CLI for reproducible performance benchmarking and established a governed model catalog to transition internal teams from ad-hoc infrastructure to a standardized, OpenAI-compatible backend

---

### Weak
> Made a presentation about neural networks.

### Strong
> Selected as an 'Apprentice Spotlight' for technical excellence; delivered a deep-dive lecture on neural network optimization, dissecting the computational complexity of backpropagation and analyzing gradient instability challenges for an audience of engineering peers

**Note on length**: The examples above are deliberately verbose to show all XYZ components clearly. In the final resume, aim for 1-2 lines per bullet to stay within the one-page limit.

## Adapting for Keyword Insertion

When tailoring for a specific JD, weave target keywords into the Z component:

**Original:**
> Developed a modular backtesting engine in Python capable of testing across multiple factor strategies

**Tailored for ML role (adding PyTorch, data pipeline keywords):**
> Developed a modular backtesting engine in Python with automated data pipelines, capable of testing across multiple factor strategies and handling heterogeneous data sources using Polars for high-performance DataFrame operations

The key is to add keywords where they naturally describe what was actually done — never fabricate.

## Quantification Strategies

When exact numbers aren't available, use these approaches:

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Scale | "for an audience of 100+ members" |
| Comparison | "reducing reporting time by over 90%" |
| Scope | "across multiple factor strategies" |
| Placement | "1st place out of 100+ participants" |
| Frequency | "weekly performance reports" |
| Team size | "led a two-person team" |

## Awards & Certifications Formatting

Awards and competition entries should follow a structured format that leads with the year and quantifies the achievement:

```
[Year] | [Quantification] [Competition/Award]
```

**Examples:**

| Entry | Formatted |
|-------|-----------|
| NTU hackathon win | 2025 \| 1st place out of 100+ participants \| NTU x Base Web3 Hackathon |
| CFA challenge | 2024 \| Top 10 finalist \| CFA Institute Research Challenge |
| AI competition | 2024 \| 2nd place out of 50 teams \| SuperAI Season 2 Hackathon |

The quantification (placement + pool size) provides immediate context for the significance of the award. Always include the competition scale when available.
