name: behavioral-interview-prepper
description: This skill should be used when the user wants to prepare for behavioral interviews, generate a behavioral answer bank, or practice STAR-format answers mapped to their real experiences. Trigger phrases include "prep behavioral", "behavioral interview prep", "prep me for interview at", "practice behavioral questions", "generate behavioral answers", "behavioral prep for", "interview stories for", "STAR method answers", "prep my stories", "answer bank for interview", or when a user has completed a resume-builder run and asks for interview preparation. It chains off resume-builder output (notes.md, resume.tex, candidate-context.md) to produce a tailored question-and-answer bank. If no resume-builder output exists, guide the user to run resume-builder first.

# Behavioral Interview Prepper

Generate a tailored behavioral interview answer bank from resume-builder output. Output goes to the same `hojicha/<company>-<role>-resume/` directory as `behavioral-prep.md`.

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER fabricate experiences.** Only use content from the resume and `candidate-context.md`. Rephrase and reframe — never invent.
2. **Chain from resume-builder output.** Read existing `notes.md` and `resume.tex` from the output directory. Do not re-parse the JD from scratch.
3. **Honest gap handling.** When the candidate lacks an experience for a question, provide a deflection strategy — not a made-up story.
4. **Story reuse limit.** No single experience may be used for more than 3 questions. Spread stories across the answer bank.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Parse Inputs

Read from the existing resume-builder output directory:

```
Required:
- hojicha/<company>-<role>-resume/notes.md (JD summary, keyword analysis, gap analysis)
- hojicha/<company>-<role>-resume/resume.tex (tailored resume bullets)
- hojicha/candidate-context.md (supplementary experiences beyond the resume)
```

Derive the company name and role from the directory name or the JD summary in `notes.md`.

**If required files do not exist:** Prompt the user to run the `resume-builder` skill first with the target JD. This skill requires resume-builder output — it does not accept raw JD/resume input directly.

### Step 2: Extract Behavioral Signals

Scan the JD keywords and culture indicators from `notes.md`. Map each behavioral keyword to a trait cluster (e.g., "fast-paced" → Adaptability, "cross-functional" → Collaboration). Weight clusters by frequency. See `references/behavioral-signals.md` for the full taxonomy.

### Step 3: Predict Questions

Select 10-15 questions from the master bank based on the top-weighted trait clusters and the role type. Prioritize primary clusters, then fill with secondary clusters. See `references/question-bank.md` for the full question bank.

### Step 4: Map Experiences to Questions

For each predicted question, find the best-fit experience from the tailored resume bullets and `candidate-context.md`. Reframe the experience to match the question's trait cluster. Enforce the 3-question reuse limit. See `references/story-mapping.md` for mapping methodology.

### Step 5: Generate Answers

Write a structured answer for each question using the appropriate format based on question type. Answers should be detailed enough to serve as speaking notes but not scripted word-for-word. See `references/answer-formats.md` for templates.

### Step 6: Finance Layer (Conditional)

If the role is in finance, trading, or quant, load the finance-specific behavioral layer. Detect by scanning `notes.md` for keywords listed in the "When to Load" section of `references/finance-behavioral.md`. Add domain-specific questions and adjust answer framing for finance culture.

### Step 7: Output

Write `behavioral-prep.md` in the same output directory:

```
hojicha/<company>-<role>-resume/
  notes.md            # Already exists (from resume-builder)
  resume.tex          # Already exists (from resume-builder)
  cover-letter.md     # May exist (from resume-builder)
  behavioral-prep.md  # Generated by this skill
```

## Output Structure

The generated `behavioral-prep.md` should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Behavioral Interview Prep: <Company> — <Role>

## Quick Reference

### Question Type → Answer Format

| Question Type | Answer Format | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| "Tell me about a time..." | STAR with metrics | `references/answer-formats.md` |
| "Why this company/role?" | Thesis (3 reasons) | `references/answer-formats.md` |
| "What would you do if..." | Framework-first | `references/answer-formats.md` |
| "Strengths/weaknesses" | Claim + proof + growth | `references/answer-formats.md` |
| "Tell me about yourself" | Present → Past → Future | `references/answer-formats.md` |
