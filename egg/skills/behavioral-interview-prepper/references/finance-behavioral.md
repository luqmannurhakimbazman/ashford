## Finance-Specific Questions

### Why Trading / Why Finance?

- "What's the difference between a trader's mindset and an engineer's mindset?" [behavioral, standard, quant]

### Risk & Decision-Making

- "Describe a time you took a calculated risk." [behavioral, standard, quant]
- "How do you make decisions with incomplete information?" [behavioral, standard, quant]
- "Tell me about a time you were wrong and had to change course quickly." [behavioral, standard, general]
- "How do you decide when to cut losses?" [hypothetical, standard, quant]

### Market Awareness

- "What's the most interesting thing happening in markets right now?" [motivational, standard, quant]
- "If I gave you $1M to invest today, what would you do?" [hypothetical, standard, quant]
- "What trade are you following right now?" [motivational, standard, quant]
- "What market event surprised you most this year?" [motivational, standard, quant]

### Quantitative Thinking

- "Walk me through how you'd evaluate a trading strategy." [hypothetical, standard, quant]
- "How would you estimate [market size / probability / fair value]?" [hypothetical, probing, quant]

## Answer Guidance

### Core Principles

1. **Show genuine market interest** — reference specific instruments, tickers, or macro events, not vague sectors. "I'm watching the 2s10s curve flattening" beats "I follow interest rates."
2. **Demonstrate risk-reward thinking** — quantify trade-offs. Frame decisions as expected value calculations: probability of outcome times magnitude.
3. **Admit uncertainty confidently** — "I don't know, but here's how I'd think about it" is a strong answer. Trading desks value intellectual honesty over false conviction.
4. **Connect tech skills to trading value** — "My ML background helps with signal extraction from noisy data" or "I built systems that process real-time feeds at low latency."
5. **For "Why trading" from a tech background** — bridge analytical skills, real-time decision feedback loops, meritocratic PnL measurement, and the intellectual challenge of markets.

### Answering Market Awareness Questions

- Pick a specific position or view. Vague answers signal disinterest.
- State the thesis, the risk, and what would change your mind.
- Demonstrate you consume market data regularly (Bloomberg, FT, sell-side research, macro podcasts).
- For the "$1M to invest" question: state asset class, instrument, time horizon, sizing rationale, and risk management.

## Trader Mindset Signals

| Signal | What They Want to Hear | Red Flag to Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| Quick decision-making | Comfort making calls with incomplete info | "I'd need more data first" |
| Intellectual curiosity | Genuine market interest with specifics | Generic "I like finance" |
| Admitting when wrong | "I was wrong because X, learned Y" | Never wrong, blames others |
| Competitive drive | Wants to win, channels productively | Arrogant, dismissive |
| Resilience under pressure | Stays composed when pushed back | Gets defensive, flustered |
| Comfort with uncertainty | Articulates views despite unknowns | Only speaks in certainties |

## Selection Guidance

When the JD triggers this file, add 3-5 questions from the sections above to the standard `question-bank.md` selection. Prioritize:

1. **Why Trading / Why Finance** — always include at least 1 if the candidate is transitioning from tech
2. **Market Awareness** — always include at least 1; interviewers use these as engagement filters
3. **Risk & Decision-Making** — include 1-2 based on role seniority (more for trader roles, fewer for quant dev)
4. **Quantitative Thinking** — include for quant researcher / quant trader roles specifically
