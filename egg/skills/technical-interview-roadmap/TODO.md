# TODO-1: DONE
* ~~skill needs to be able to extract jd from url as well not just "Reads JD analysis" from notes.md~~
* Implemented: Direct JD URL/text input with DSA-focused extraction (Step 1b). notes.md dependency removed entirely.

# TODO-1.5: DONE
* ~~404 on company frequency fetch (e.g., crypto.com) felt like a dead end~~
* Implemented: De-emphasized Step 6a as "Optional Bonus", dropped six-months.csv fallback, tightened failure messaging to normalize missing data.

# TODO-2:
* skill presumes that entry level has an easy-medium focus but competitive firms can and will test mediums/hards for conceptual understanding.

# TODO-3:
* skill needs to BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR that the companies set questions to test candidates on specific foundational concepts relevant to their workflow/core inhouse technology, the questions are not chosen at random. As such, suggest questions that are relevant to the company's business and techstack.

# TODO-4:
* repetition noticed in jd-signals, there's a separate file jd-signals.md and within the technical-roadmap.md there's an even deeper section on jd-signals
